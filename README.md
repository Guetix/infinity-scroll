# infinity-scroll
Developed an infinite scrolling feature in React.js leveraging the IntersectionObserver API, 
offering a seamless and responsive loading experience as users scroll, enhancing content discovery.

## Easy Integration of Infinity Scroll in Your React Project
<br/>
Steps:
<ul>
<li>Clone or download the Infinity Scroll project. </li>
<li>Copy the files and paste it into your React project directory.</li>
<li>Import "publicList.js" into your React App component.</li>
<li>Add <publicList /> within your component's JSX to enable infinite scrolling.</li>
<li>Install Axios for making API requests, if not already installed.</li>
</ul>
In the project. I used the API: 'https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1' which offers 25 products.
To implement this, I used The **Intersection Observer API** to keep track of each new product that is added to the list,
and as soon it is displayed on the screen, the next product will be fetching.

Enjoy dynamic content loading with infinite scrolling in your React project!
