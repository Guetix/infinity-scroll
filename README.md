# infinity-scroll
Create an infinity scroll in React.js using IntersectionObserver

In the project. I used the API: 'https://fakestoreapi.com/products/1' which offers 25 products.
To implement this, I used The **Intersection Observer API** to keep track of each new product that is added to the list,
and as soon it is displayed on the screen, the next product will be fetching.
